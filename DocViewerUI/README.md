## DocViewerUI

### This is UI part of ViewDocsAPI project
### I've implemented this using express js.

### It has mainly two web pages as below
#### 1. index.html --> Launch page, where you can search for folder contents and download them.
#### 2. upload.html --> In this, you can upload a file from local machine to google drive by specifying google drive's folder path (e.g. /MyDir/sample.txt)
